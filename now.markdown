> I think having a "Now" page is a good idea, not to tell the others what you're currently doing - or it may be so, but generally people don't care about others. It is a good idea because it keeps you accountable, it makes you think about what you did and what you're doing at the present time. Moreover, it's a good substitute for social media: you can see what I'm up to right there, in the Now page. I got in touch with the idea of a "Now" page [here](https://nownownow.com/).

## What am I doing *now*

I'm currently working as Data Analyst at [SDG](https://sdggroup.com), mainly focused on the Microsoft technology stack.
I do a lot of Power BI stuff, which makes me a *business analyst", as they call it.

During my *free time* I work on my master thesis, I try to keep up with as much tech
stuff I like as possible, specifically the Bitcoin protocol developments.

## What am I reading *now*

I'm currently reading *Dubliners* (James Joyce).

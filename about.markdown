Hi!
Since you are reading these lines, it's time for introductions!

I'm Filippo, an italian 25 years old guy currently pursuing a Master's degree in
Data Analytics at Ca'Foscari University of Venice. I'm passionate about
technology, love reading and am fascinated by everything
related to science. Lately I've been deeping into various topics regarding digital
payments, like chaumian ecash systems, peer to peer electronic payments and specifically
the Bitcoin protocol.

Why this blog?

[*Nulla dies sine linea*](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nulla_dies_sine_linea)
is a very famous Latin phrase that literally means
*no day without a line*. I firstly encountered this quote while reading a short
essay by Franco Volpi, which served as an introduction to a new edition of the famous
*Senilia* by Schopenhauer. In the essay, Volpi emphasizes the importance of
recording daily thoughts, reflections, and events in written form.

> Just like a bee that gathers pollen by flying from flower to flower during
> the day and, come evening, does not let it disperse but condenses it into
> honey, so too the fruits of the varied readings we undertake throughout the day
> risk being lost if we do not collect and condense them in written form.

This is the *reason why* for this blog: to gather my reflections on topics
dear to me, on readings I've done, or simply to put that *line* down.

Since a few years I've been discussing a lot with bitcoin advocates,
bitcoin developers and people who consider themselves bitcoin users.
Among other topics, the one that comes up more often (because I push
it into discussions a lot) is the concept of spending bitcoin rather than
simply keeping them as a long-term value reserve and fiat economy edge.

I've come to the conclusion that *spending bitcoin* is considered an
unpopular opinion at best, stupid at worse, with very very few bitcoin
users willing to spend their funds in the real economy (even provided the opportunity
to buy them back). This tendency is usually justified by recalling the
**Gresham Law**, whereby the *bad money* is supposed to be spent before the
**good money**, because economic agents are willing to free themselves from bad
store of value and keep the good store of value money in their pockets.

This is rather understandable and makes the tendency of not spending bitcoin
a justifiable attitude. At the end of the day, if you buy the idea
of the *digital gold*, you should realize that fiat currency tends to be
devalued throughout the decades, whereas store of value assets
tend to not be devalued because of various properties.

I've no issues with this approach to bitcoin spending.
Nonetheless, in my opinion, spending bitcoin is the only way
to boost its adoption and make it *actually useful*.
Holding an asset *to the moon* with your *diamond hands* is
not going to create value in the economy, is not going to
make the ecosystem grow. It's supposedly making your bags
a bit larger only if *the others* out there actually use the
asset for its properties, claiming their sovreignty and thus
enhancing possible future purchasing power. Still, you don't
have *purchasing power* if you don't *purchase* stuff.

## First movers and sats-payable services

The first *certified* bitcoin purchase dates back in 2010, when a guy
called Laszlo Hanyecz arranged an exchange with an another user of the
forum BitcoinTalk. At the time Laszlo agreed to pay 10'000 bitcoin in order
to get two large Papa John's pizzas. The other user payed the pizzas for
him and received bitcoin in exchange.

Although today almost everyone calls Laszlo *crazy* and makes jokes about
him, probably that purchase is the reason why bitcoin gained some
market and technological traction during the following decade.

The first *real* **medium-of-exchange** application of bitcoin dates back
in 2011, when Ross Ulbricht created the dark market *Silk Road*, an online
hidden service website where buyers and sellers where free to exchange any
product. Trades happened almost always in bitcoin, because of its properties
of *pseudonimity* and *uncensorability*.
The website was unfortunately[^1] shut down a couple of years later, but the
genie was finally out of the bottle, the real bitcoin nature of being a global
unstoppable digital monetary protocol was finally more widely understood.

[^1]: I consider it an *unfortunate* event for the following reasons:
    - the most traded items in SilkRoad were banished books, often religious books;
    - SilkRoad had an internal ethical code whereby murder-related, child-related and violent crimes where prohibited;
    - Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to **double life imprisonment** for administering the website, which is an exagerated sentence at best;
    - SilkRoad fame of being a good drug-dealing platform was possibly an opportunity to take the drug monopoly out of the Mafia hands. Drug-related crimes are going to exist forever, that was at least an attempt to change the market into a more transparent one.

Drug dealers and naive users of SilkRoad can be considered a group of early
adopters of bitcoin, a group strongly motivated to learn a new technology despite
the burdain of tech annoyances. The *need* for the tool was what drove
them to adopt it. And almost all of them learned the details about bitcoin **after**
being somehow forced to use it for their needs. That adoption was certainly
*supply driven*, meaning that the drug dealers were willing to sell products
**only** in exchange for bitcoin, thus if someone was willing to get that drug,
the leap to bitcoin adoption was necessary. Sats-payable services generated
customers willing to spend the sats. But that worked also on the other way around:
customers understood the advantages of not being exposed to possible phisical violence
from drug dealers and moved to SilkRoad. If you were an old school drug dealer you would have
to open your mind and start selling on SilkRoad, otherwise you would have lost some
of your precious customers.

The dynamics of supply-driven or demand-driven sats-payable services
can be compared to the classical chicken and egg problem, whereby one
phenomenon needs the other one in order to thrive.
If merchants are not willing to sell their products for sats, customers
have no way to let their sats flow into the economy. On the flip side,
if there is no demand for sats-payable products and services, merchants
will not be willing to put into the work of learning, adopting the technology
and possibly paying fees to get payment-processor like services.

There's no simple solution to this matter, no globally optimal
solution. Possibly some local-optima solutions exist and we should aim to achieve those.
I'm not expecting some sort of serendipitous outcome from non-bitcoin
friendly merchants whereby they're going to start accepting
bitcoin overnight just because of "the price", its gold-like nature
or other aspects usually bitcoiners riff about.
I'm especting bitcoiners to go out there and
talk to people, to be willing to spend their sats in the real economy,
not exchanging them for fiat currency but directly with services and products.
I think that the chicken comes first, the breathing thing shall act.
The bitcoiner should make the first move into the real world.

Bitcoiners cannot expect the World "to be catched by Bitcoin": **if you
don't make the stuff there is no stuff**. If you don't act there is
no effect. If you don't start selling your services in exchange for
bitcoin, if you are not willing to spend your bitcoin at the grocery
store nearby that accepts it...then the World is not going to follow.

## Testing, bugs and readyness

Research and development of new products come at multiple costs:

1. economical cost of paying someone working at the product;
2. it costs time to the developer(s) working at the producs;
3. it costs time to the users adopting the product in the initial stage,
because initally new raw products could be painful to use, tricky,
not intuitive;
4. it costs (hopefully not too many) sats to the early adopters and users
that are actually trying out that product, especially if referring
to a wallet prototype.

There may be more aspects that I did not consider, but overall this is
how I perceive the costs of new bitcoin products. And they all come
bundled together, not separable one from the other.

If there's no founding, eventually developers will stop building or
mantaining.
If there's no time to develop, the product is not marketed.
If the product is shipped but no users adopt it, there is no way to
test bugs, understand its feasibiliy for the broader market and in
the long run things just slow down and eventually devs are not motivated
to work, users don't see improvements in the product. The market
spits out the product from its dynamics: the wallet, the app,
the service is not in *the game* anymore, it disappears.
With regards to point 4, hopefully the alpha version of the product does
not lead to fund losses,
but in the end an early adopter shall be willing to risk in order
to test and signal bugs, thus the risk of losses must be taken into account.

By going out there and using the wallets, testing node implementations and
services users signal to the tech market niche of bitcoin-focused
developers that there is demand for these products, that some work is needed.
And since bitcoin is a monetary asset, one of the main use cases of it
is **to be sent back and forth**, to be exchanged in various ways. Some
merchants need wallets with offline capabilities, some need static
invoice creation, some need security features to be sure that employees
do not steal the funds. Users have some clear needs too.

How can **we** possibly make better lightning wallets if nobody is
willing to spend some lightning sats? How can **we** possibly build a
better *receiver experience* if merchants are not going to receive our
money?

How can bitcoin-focused companies be sustainable if they're not able
to make a living out of their activity with an healthy business model?

I don't buy the idea of *when we'll need it we'll figure that out*,
because we won't be ready in the future if we don't start
supporting and working on it now.
Spending sats, accepting sats in exchange for our services and
being willing to spend them for other's services and products is
the only way to make our industry able to welcome new users, new adoption.
Otherwise, there will be no room for sats-payable services in the tomorrow's
economy.

As the saying goes

## Social networks, tips and lightning integrations

A ton of new projects, proposals and protocols are vividly discussed within
the bitcoin development industry and this is fine.
Nonetheless, the only real production-ready protocols as of now are:

- the Bitcoin timechain (aka the *blockchain*);
- the Lightning Network protocol.

Despite being both rooted in the Bitcoin base timechain protocol, they have different market fits,
the demand for their use is critically different, use cases are pretty distinguishable.
Specifically, the properties of the *timechain* make it worth using for long
term storage of funds, for high-amount transactions,
but also for non financial applications like timestamping and Proof Of Existence.
On the other hand, the Lightning Network protocol is mostly used for microtransactions,
recurrent transactions and to embed more elasticity in the programmability of bitcoin
spending.

It's pretty clear that these are different tools and can be employed to solve different
problems. Moreover, users are willing to accept different compromises if using these
protocols. For example, self custody for onchain funds is usually considered a *must-have*
for an onchain wallet, whereas for lightning wallets it's widely accepted the *custodian-ship*
compromise.

My intuition - that is also widely confirmed by the products in the market - is that
the features of Lightning Network-based wallets and services are clearly
well suited for the digital realm of social networks, tipping systems, recurrent
payments to services like video or audio streaming. All these appications involve needs
that also *non-bitconers* have, often associated with high-volume and low-amounts transactions
that therefore can even justify the lack of self-ownership of the funds from the user endsight.

If you ever tried a custodial lighting wallet like Wallet Of Satoshi, you know that
the user experience for custodial lightning wallets is even better than the one
provided by traditional
fintech companies. And even self-custodial lightning wallets are catching up with
this performances, like Phoenix Wallet or Mutiny.
This products are market ready, what's needed is the adoption by the
bitcoin-focused user base and, more importantly, what is needed is the integration
of *lightning features* in *normie products* (aka applications, websites, services
aiming at a broader market of users, not the bitcoin-focused one).

My belief is that if bitcoiners are willing to make the sats flow,
the incentive to add bitcoin support into services/apps is likely to
increase. At the end of the day customer is king and if customer wants
this *lightning network tips* thingy to be added to his/her favourite app,
companies will possibly integrate the required features.

My belief is that this step is crucial to make bitcoin *actually useful*,
to transform it into a pop tool and remove the silly belief that "that's
only a speculative asset".

## Marketing, adoption and trust in airplanes

My final take on this matter concerns the "marketing aspect" of Bitcoin as a
protocol and as a tool.
Fortunately there's no foundation, company, institution or government that it's in charge
for setting up bitcoin marketing campaigns, just like there was no central
institution in charge for the marketing campaigns of the TCP/IP stack.
The direct consequence of it is that every company integrating the product is phrasing
its product communication and marketing at their own terms.

It's in the interest of every company to narrate the product as easy to use, feature-rich,
not dangerous. And it's in their interest to actually make the product as such.
My belief is that even bitcoin users have a role in this marketing *battle*:
they need to be involved in communicating properly the tool, being willing to discuss it,
not acting as dumb brainless faith-driven people but as thoughful users of a
technologically dense tool.

Bitcoiners are the ultimate marketing strategy for bitcoin adoption: to let everyone
else see bitcoin as an easy technology, we must use it. We have to testify that the
protocol works by actually using it, by showing to the world that the protocol is not
going to break, just like airplane pilots gain passengers' trust by having thousands
active flight hours without crashes.

At the end, bitcoiners are required to provide to the World Proof Of (that It) Works,
proving that Bitcoin works and can be useful to a large amount of people worldwide,
that anyone can use it at their own terms and accepting tradeoffs as they are more
willing to.

For a monetary tool the sublime, most representative proof of usefulness
is the act of using it for spending, which usually is also the ultimate proof of ownership.

Making it useful means creating a fertile context for developers to work on real
world applications of bitcoin and built on top of the Bitcoin stack, it means
stimulating outflows of bitcoin in the real economy.

It also means letting everyone
else know that the tool we are laboriously and restlessly working on is ready to
be used, it's easy enough and can be integrated in a wide group of applications.
If we manage to deliver this message, I'm persuaded that the value of the countless
development hours and resources invested in this ecosystem will be properly acknowledged
and finally Bitcoin will be a protocol and a tool **used** by anyone and not only
**for** anyone.

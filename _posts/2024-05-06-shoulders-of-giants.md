I would not be here if giants didn't exist in the past, you would not be reading
this and probably cavemen would be still wondering about in the green plains next
to the Victoria Lake.

Mankind thrives thanks to findings, the social and collective effort of
thousands of generations of human beings, working restlessly to push the limits
beyond imaginable.
If this sounds very biblical to you it's because it is: as a civilization we
triumph thanks to the thousands that tried, missed, retried and eventually succeded
at something great.

Greatness is sometimes very compelling and immediately recognizable, such as the
findings of Marie Curie or the inventions of Da Vinci. More often than not though,
greatness is hidden from the first eyesight, it's not on the surface of the events
but on the backstage, constituting the backbone of the new advancements.

Being at the edge of the human restless research efforts, Technology
is one of the most impacted fields with respect to **giants'** contribute.
We're living now the years of a blossoming AI and deep learning ecosystem that is
almost totally build upon theorems, papers and intuitions dating back to the '60s
and '70s: the old ideas and their proponents are the giants of today's advancements,
with no doubts at all.

## Free access to open ideas

I'm profoundly convinced that the blossoming of innovation comes as a consequence
of freedom to read and learn from other's findings, sharing with them ideas and
being able to build on top of one's conclusions. This attitude was well known back
in the days when scholars belonging to different countries shared almost freely
relevant scientific findings despite being citizens of hostile countries.

But academia is not the only beneficiary of these tendencies. Even private citizens,
free individuals can leverage the openness of information sharing to refine their
knowledge, create new products and services, sharpen their knowledge of the world.

And since information is freely available online, we're pointed towards democratization
of knowledge, openness of information sources, liberty to freely read and share
any findings, especially the ones that were so selflessly given to us by giants
of the past, isn't it?

## Paywalled gardens

The definition of *giant* that I provided above is still too strict: we need to
understand that even anonymous contributors to StackerOverflow are giants, because
millions of visitors can benefit from their generous contributions to create new
things and thrive. Even reddit weirdos can be giants, forum members can be giants,
Quora top voted answers can be as valuable as essays.

All these platforms and online spots have one thing in common: people can meet,
help each other freely and leave a trace that is still relevant
for anyone in the future, possibly helpful to anyone that is bothered enough to
search carefully and find the content again.

Detailed answers in technical forums and blogs are as important as documentation
and official materials, a tribute to Mankind knowledge assembled with the efforts
of silent knowledgeable individuals.

So what?

Despite tons of efforts, the online world started shrinking and redistributing
its volume of users into paywalled gardens of knowledge, where the access to
information is now conditioned to the creation of an account. Discussions are now
held as twitter threads (yeah, I know now it's called X, but the new name is so
annoyingly strange that I continue to deadname it); access to APIs is being shut
down from basically every social media, short content content is spreading beyond
repair.
Communities started burying themselves into closed platforms like
Discord, Telegram groups, Whatsapp communities: there every community-related
discussion is held without letting then successful discussions and answers come out of the paywalled
garden. The once blossoming web of forums and community websites is now dying under
this exodus of users.

## Free riding on the shoulders of giants

> *In economics, the free-rider problem is a type of market failure that occurs
when those who benefit from resources, public goods and common pool resources
do not pay for them or under-pay.*

Contributing to the open discussion and flow of ideas is like paying the price
of the great contributions that were submitted by other knowledgeable users,
perpetuating and consistently alimenting the Heritage that open ideas left to us.

By closing ourselves into paywalled gardens we destroy the opportunity
for our peers to benefit from our legacy, but we also limit
the future users' chance to build on top of our findings, we destroy our
opportunity to be contributors to the unstoppable stream of human ideas.

**Ultimately, free riding on the shoulders of giants benefits nobody**, it's a badly
thought time discounting choice that can terribly impact the value and efforts that
were made to make information freely available, giants' *dixit* easily accessible
and the Internet an open protocol for ideas.
